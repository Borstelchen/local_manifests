Git LFS
~~~~~~~

One of my repositories is using Git Large File Storage (LFS).
More Information here:
https://git-lfs.github.com/

You need to install "git-lfs" by your distribution package manager or like described above.

To 'repo sync' please follow these steps:

1. /android/lineage-16.0> git lfs install

2. /android/lineage-16.0> repo sync

3. /android/lineage-16.0> repo forall -c "git lfs pull"

Have a lot of fun!
Yours, Borstelchen
